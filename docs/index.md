# Crank ML

A selection of single-file machine learning recipes for `pytorch`. The provided implementations are intended to be self-contained and reusable in different contexts and problems. The goals of this project is:

* Single-file implementation. Each component and single script only depends on `pytorch` and is placed in a single file. As such there may be duplicated code in places, but this is _intentional_. 
* Provide recipes via examples for machine learning use cases in a manner that is comparable to `scikit-learn`.
